# jetson-apps
> Applications run on the Jetson Orin of the OmniNxt quadcam platform
## Background
This is mainly based on the [D2SLAM](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/D2SLAM.git) introduced by HKUST Aerial Robotics Group. Currently used for personal learning purposes in order to understand how the D2SLAM works.

## Intro
This directory contains the applications that would be installed on the Jeston Orin SBC, and the applications are dockerized for smooth reproduction. It seems that there is already docker containers built by the HKUST Aerial Robotics Group for the OmniNxt D2SLAM, since I could not find it, I will build the docker by myself, also modify the source code along the way of learing D2SLAM to fit my own needs.

## Build

To make things clear, these applications should either be built on the Jeston, or pull the pre-built docker images on the Jetson. Building the docker images on Jetson may take a while, so if the pre-built images are known do pull them to the Jetson and run directly from that.

## Run

TBA
